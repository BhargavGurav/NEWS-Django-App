# NEWS-Django-App
<h2>This is a NEWS webapp created using Django ( by me 	&#128513;)</h2>
<hr>
<p>In this webapp there is only one page where news are loaded in cards. In the navigation bar there is one search field in which viewer can type the keyword about which news he/she wants to read.
So after hitting enter after typing keyword news realted to that word are  loaded in place of news which were shown first.</p>
